##Project Synopsis

The code is to help you to make a voice-recognition Robot. This was done in Ubuntu Platform.

Julius Software will help you to give speech commands to your laptop or PC and through a terminal command given in the Readme.md file in the julius software section you can convert your speech command to text in a file which is made in real time using a particular library in C.

After converting to text , the code receives the text from the file saved and gives the command to the IRobot through BAM (Bluetooth Access Module). Afterwards the file gets deleted in real time and the process continues.

##Use

Looking at today's world everything is becoming automatic and so this was just an attempt to make it more.
